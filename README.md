LCDST7032SPI
============

This library allows an Arduino board to control LiquidCrystal displays (LCDs) based on the `ST7032` chipset (SPI interface, plus `RS`, `RST` signals).

Support All Arduino-type devices.

Tested with NewHaven displays (eg. NHD-C0216CZ-FSW-FBW-3V3)

The LCD is controled by 5 pins:
  - Reset
  - RS
  - CS
  - SCK
  - MOSI

The RESET pin, Register Select (RS) and Chip Select (CS) can be defined by the user in the instance of the Object LCDST7032SPI. The pins SCK and MOSI are the standar pins used by the SPI library (SPI.h)

## USE of Library

Include the headers:
```
#include "LCDST7032SPI.h"
#include "SPI.h"
```

Instance a new object:
```
LCDST7032SPI lcd(_PIN_RST_, _PIN_RS_, _PIN_CS_);  // Pins MOSI and SCK are the Arduino Standar
```

Inicialize the LCD with the standar config (inside the setup):
```
lcd.init();
```
